# MotifFinder
Finder for short degenerate motifs in protein sequences from Infectious Bronchitis Virus

Given one or several fasta `(*.fasta)` files containing one or several fasta formatted protein codes, the program will find defined Motifs by regex expressions, create a folder with the time of execution and the results as positive sequences where the motifs where found.
